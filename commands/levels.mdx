# Leveling Commands

The leveling system rewards active members with XP and levels based on their participation in the server. These commands allow members to check their progress and administrators to configure level rewards.

## Member Commands

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `level` | View your current level and XP | `!level [@user]` | `!level` |
| `leaderboard` | View the server's XP leaderboard | `!leaderboard` | `!leaderboard` |

## Administrator Commands

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `levelrole` | View level role rewards | `!levelrole` | `!levelrole` |
| `levelrole add` | Add a role reward for a level | `!levelrole add <level> <role>` | `!levelrole add 5 @Role` |
| `levelrole remove` | Remove a role reward | `!levelrole remove <level>` | `!levelrole remove 5` |

## How the Leveling System Works

Members earn XP by participating in text channels. The system has the following features:

- Members earn 15-25 XP per message
- There is a 60-second cooldown between XP gains
- The XP required for each level increases with each level
- Level-up notifications can be configured to appear in a specific channel
- Role rewards are automatically assigned when members reach the configured levels

## Required Permissions

- Member commands can be used by anyone
- Administrator commands require the **Manage Server** permission
