# Security Commands

Security commands provide advanced protection for your Discord server against raids, nukes, and other malicious activities. These features help server owners maintain control and prevent unauthorized actions.

## Anti-Nuke Protection

Anti-nuke protection prevents unauthorized users from making destructive changes to your server, such as mass-deleting channels or roles.

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `antinuke` | View anti-nuke status | `!antinuke` | `!antinuke` |
| `antinuke enable` | Enable anti-nuke protection | `!antinuke enable` | `!antinuke enable` |
| `antinuke disable` | Disable anti-nuke protection | `!antinuke disable` | `!antinuke disable` |
| `antinuke whitelist add` | Add a user to the anti-nuke whitelist | `!antinuke whitelist add @user` | `!antinuke whitelist add @user` |
| `antinuke whitelist remove` | Remove a user from the anti-nuke whitelist | `!antinuke whitelist remove @user` | `!antinuke whitelist remove @user` |
| `antinuke whitelist list` | View the anti-nuke whitelist | `!antinuke whitelist list` | `!antinuke whitelist list` |

## Anti-Raid Protection

Anti-raid protection helps prevent coordinated attacks on your server by detecting and handling sudden influxes of new members or suspicious activity.

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `antiraid` | View anti-raid status | `!antiraid` | `!antiraid` |
| `antiraid enable` | Enable anti-raid protection | `!antiraid enable` | `!antiraid enable` |
| `antiraid disable` | Disable anti-raid protection | `!antiraid disable` | `!antiraid disable` |
| `antiraid threshold` | Set the anti-raid detection threshold | `!antiraid threshold <number>` | `!antiraid threshold 10` |
| `antiraid action` | Set the action to take when a raid is detected | `!antiraid action <kick/ban/mute>` | `!antiraid action ban` |
| `antiraid logs` | View recent anti-raid logs | `!antiraid logs` | `!antiraid logs` |

## Security Best Practices

For optimal server security:

1. Only add trusted users to the anti-nuke whitelist
2. Regularly review your security logs
3. Set appropriate thresholds for your server size
4. Combine anti-raid with verification systems for new members
5. Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions to enforce security measures

These security features are designed to work alongside Discord's built-in security measures and should be configured according to your server's specific needs.
