# Social Commands

Social commands allow members to view information from various social media platforms directly in Discord. These integrations help connect your Discord community with other online platforms.

## Social Media Profiles

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `instagram` | View information about an Instagram profile | `!instagram <username>` | `!instagram discord` |
| `twitter` | View information about a Twitter profile | `!twitter <username>` | `!twitter discord` |
| `tiktok` | View information about a TikTok profile | `!tiktok <username>` | `!tiktok discord` |

## Account Linking

To use certain social media features, members may need to link their accounts:

1. **Spotify**: Use the Spotify authentication flow to link your account
2. **Last.fm**: Use the Last.fm authentication flow to link your account

Once accounts are linked, additional personalized commands become available.

## Usage Notes

- Social commands can be used by anyone in the server
- Information displayed is publicly available from each platform's API
- Some commands may have rate limits based on API restrictions
- Profile information is cached briefly to improve performance

These commands require no special permissions to use and are available to all server members.
