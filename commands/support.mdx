# Support Commands

Support commands enable server administrators to set up a ticket system for member support. This system allows members to create private channels for getting help from staff.

## Ticket Commands

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- | ------- |
| `ticket` | Create a support ticket | `!ticket [reason]` | `!ticket Need help with commands` |
| `close` | Close an active ticket | `!close [reason]` | `!close Issue resolved` |

## How the Ticket System Works

1. When a member uses the `!ticket` command, a new private channel is created
2. The channel is only visible to the member who created the ticket and server staff
3. All messages in the ticket channel are logged for future reference
4. Staff members can use the `!close` command to close the ticket when the issue is resolved
5. When a ticket is closed, the channel is deleted after a transcript is created

## Administrator Setup

Server administrators can configure the ticket system with these settings:

- Support role (staff who can view tickets)
- Ticket category (where ticket channels are created)
- Ticket logs channel (where ticket transcripts are sent)
- Custom ticket welcome message

## Required Permissions

- Members need no special permissions to create tickets
- Staff need the configured support role to view and respond to tickets
- Closing tickets requires either the support role or being the ticket creator
- Setting up the ticket system requires the **Manage Server** permission
