## common permission errors

### bot cannot respond to commands

**symptoms:**

- bot doesn't respond to commands
- "bot does not have permission to send messages in this channel" error

**solutions:**

1. check if enovuh has "send messages" permission in the channel
2. ensure enovuh can "view channel" in the channel
3. check if the channel has permission overwrites that affect bots

```
,permissions check #channel
```

### cannot assign roles

**symptoms:**

- reaction roles don't work
- level rewards fail to assign
- "missing permissions" error when trying to assign roles

**solutions:**

1. ensure enovuh has "manage roles" permission
2. check if enovuh's highest role is above the roles it needs to assign
3. verify the roles aren't managed by integrations (like booster roles)

```
,debug roles
```

### music commands not working

**symptoms:**

- bot won't join voice channel
- music doesn't play
- bot joins but disconnects immediately

**solutions:**

1. ensure enovuh has these voice permissions:
   - connect
   - speak
   - use voice activity
2. check if the voice channel has user limit that's been reached
3. verify enovuh has permission to send messages in the command channel

```
,debug voice
```

### moderation commands failing

**symptoms:**

- kick or ban commands don't work
- warnings aren't saved
- "insufficient permissions" errors

**solutions:**

1. ensure enovuh has appropriate permissions (kick/ban members)
2. check if the target user has a higher role than enovuh
3. verify enovuh has "manage messages" for warn commands

```
,debug mod
```

## role hierarchy issues

discord follows a strict role hierarchy where users can only manage roles below their highest role. for enovuh to manage roles:

1. move the enovuh role above all roles it needs to manage
2. place enovuh's role below any admin roles that should be able to manage it
