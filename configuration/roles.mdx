## reaction roles

reaction roles allow server members to assign themselves roles by reacting to specific messages. this is perfect for color roles, notification roles, game roles, pronoun roles, and more.

### setting up reaction roles

to create a reaction role message:

```
,reactionrole create
```

this will start an interactive setup process where you'll choose:
1. the channel for the message
2. the content of the message
3. the roles and their corresponding reactions

### adding reaction roles to existing messages

you can add reaction roles to an existing message:

```
,reactionrole add <message_id> <emoji> <role>
```

example:
```
,reactionrole add 123456789012345678 üî¥ @Red
```

### editing reaction roles

remove a reaction role:

```
,reactionrole remove <message_id> <emoji>
```

clear all reaction roles from a message:

```
,reactionrole clear <message_id>
```

### reaction role limits

you can limit how many reaction roles a member can select from a single message:

```
,reactionrole limit <message_id> <number>
```

example:
```
,reactionrole limit 123456789012345678 2
```

### reaction role types

enovuh supports several types of reaction role behaviors:

- **normal**: member keeps all roles they select
- **unique**: member can only select one role from the group
- **verify**: role is given when reacted but not removed when unreacted
- **reverse**: role is removed when reacted and added when unreacted

change the type with:

```
,reactionrole type <message_id> <type>
```

## autoroles

autoroles are automatically assigned to members when they join your server.

### basic autorole

set up a role to be assigned to all new members:

```
,autorole add <role>
```

example:
```
,autorole add @Member
```

### multiple autoroles

you can add multiple autoroles:

```
,autorole add @Role1
,autorole add @Role2
```

### removing autoroles

remove a role from the autorole list:

```
,autorole remove <role>
```

### delayed autoroles

assign roles after a member has been in the server for a certain amount of time:

```
,autorole delay <time> <role>
```

example:
```
,autorole delay 24h @Verified
```

### account age requirement

require accounts to be a certain age before receiving autoroles:

```
,autorole age <days>
```

example:
```
,autorole age 7
```

## vanity roles

create custom colored roles for special members.

### creating a vanity role

```
,vanityrole create <name> <color>
```

example:
```
,vanityrole create Cool Person #ff5500
```

### managing vanity roles

update a vanity role:

```
,vanityrole update <user> <name> <color>
```

remove a vanity role:

```
,vanityrole remove <user>
```

## booster roles

reward members who boost your server with custom roles.

### enabling booster roles

```
,boosterrole enable
```

### customizing booster roles

set the default color for booster roles:

```
,boosterrole color <color>
```

example:
```
,boosterrole color #ff73fa
```

### custom booster roles

allow a booster to create their own custom role:

```
,myboosterrole create <name> <color>
```

update a booster role:

```
,myboosterrole update <name> <color>
```

reset a booster role to default:

```
,myboosterrole reset
```

## best practices

- **organize roles**: keep similar roles grouped together in your server settings
- **use meaningful emojis**: choose emojis that clearly represent the role's purpose
- **limit reaction roles**: avoid having too many reaction roles on a single message
- **test after setup**: verify roles are being assigned correctly
- **color coordination**: use colors that match your server's theme for better visual appeal
- **clear descriptions**: include clear descriptions in reaction role messages
- **manage permissions**: ensure enovuh has "manage roles" permission and its role is higher than any roles it needs to assign
