# leveling system

enovuh's leveling system allows you to reward active members with experience points (xp), levels, and automatic role rewards. this creates a progression system that encourages engagement in your community.

## how it works

members earn xp by chatting in your server. as they accumulate xp, they'll level up and can receive special roles automatically. the system uses a progressive xp curve, meaning higher levels require more xp to achieve.

<Card title="xp formula" icon="calculator">
  xp required for a level = 5 √ó (level¬≤) + 50 √ó level + 100
</Card>

## enabling the system

to enable the leveling system:

```
,levels unlock
```

to disable it:

```
,levels lock
```

## viewing levels

### checking your level

to see your current level and xp:

```
,rank
```

or use the alias:

```
,xp
```

### viewing someone else's level

```
,rank @username
```

### viewing the leaderboard

to see the server's top members:

```
,leaderboard
```

or

```
,levelboard
```

## configuring the system

### xp rate

adjust how quickly members earn xp:

```
,levels setrate <multiplier>
```

example:

```
,levels setrate 1.5
```

this would make members earn xp 1.5√ó faster than the default rate.

### level-up messages

customize the message sent when members level up:

```
,levels message <text>
```

available variables:

- `{user}` - mentions the user
- `{username}` - user's name without mention
- `{level}` - the new level
- `{server}` - server name

example:

```
,levels message **{username}** just reached level {level}! üéâ
```

### message mode

choose where level-up messages are sent:

```
,levels messagemode <mode>
```

available modes:

- `channel` - send in the same channel (default)
- `dm` - send via direct message
- `none` - don't send level-up messages

### viewing current configuration

to see your server's level settings:

```
,levels config
```

## level roles

automatically assign roles when members reach specific levels.

### adding a level role

```
,levels add @role <level>
```

example:

```
,levels add @Active Member 5
```

this assigns the "Active Member" role when someone reaches level 5.

### updating a level role

```
,levels update @role <level>
```

### removing a level role

```
,levels remove <level>
```

### viewing all level roles

```
,levels roles
```

### role stacking

control whether members keep lower-level roles when they level up:

```
,levels stackroles on
```

or

```
,levels stackroles off
```

## ignoring channels or roles

exclude specific channels or roles from earning xp:

```
,levels ignore #channel
```

or

```
,levels ignore @role
```

to see what's being ignored:

```
,levels list
```

## advanced management

### setting xp directly

set a specific amount of xp for a member:

```
,setxp @username <amount>
```

### removing xp

remove xp from a member:

```
,removexp @username <amount>
```

### setting level directly

set a specific level for a member:

```
,setlevel @username <level>
```

### resetting everyone's levels

to reset all levels and xp data:

```
,levels reset
```

‚ö†Ô∏è this action cannot be undone

### syncing level roles

force-update everyone's roles based on their current levels:

```
,levels sync
```

### cleaning up data

remove level data for members who have left the server:

```
,levels cleanup
```

## personal settings

### toggle level-up messages

control whether you receive level-up notifications:

```
,levelmsg on
```

or

```
,levelmsg off
```

## xp cooldown

to prevent spam, members can only earn xp once per minute in each server.

## best practices

- use level roles as incentives for active participation
- create a dedicated channel for level-up announcements
- balance xp rates to make progression feel rewarding but not too easy
- consider ignoring bot command channels to focus xp on genuine conversation
- use the leveling system alongside other engagement features for best results
