## troubleshooting

if you encounter issues with music playback:

1. ensure enovuh has the necessary permissions
2. check if the song or playlist is available in your region
3. try using a direct link instead of a search term
4. use the `,reconnect` command to refresh the connection
5. make sure the bot has permission to join and speak in the channel

for persistent issues, contact our support team via the support server.
