## thread auto-creation

automatically create threads from new messages in specific channels:

```
,thread auto #channel
```

this will create a new thread for each message posted in the specified channel. perfect for support requests, suggestions, or feedback channels.

to disable:

```
,thread noauto #channel
```

## thread settings

### thread duration

set how long threads stay active before archiving:

```
,thread duration <time>
```

available durations:
- `1h` - 1 hour
- `24h` - 24 hours
- `3d` - 3 days (requires boost level 1)
- `7d` - 7 days (requires boost level 2)

### thread naming

customize the format for automatically created threads:

```
,thread format <format>
```

variables:
- `{username}` - thread creator's username
- `{count}` - incremental counter
- `{topic}` - first 10 words of the message
- `{date}` - current date

example:
```
,thread format support-{username}-{count}
```

## bulk thread management

### archive all threads

archive all threads in a channel:

```
,thread archiveall #channel
```

### lock all threads

lock all threads in a channel:

```
,thread lockall #channel
```

### list all threads

view all active threads in the server:

```
,thread list
```

## moderator controls

these commands require manage threads permission:

### slow mode

set a cooldown for messages in a thread:

```
,thread slowmode <seconds> [thread]
```

example:
```
,thread slowmode 5
```

### private threads

make a thread private or public:

```
,thread private [thread]
```

```
,thread public [thread]
```

### thread pruning

remove inactive threads older than a specified time:

```
,thread prune <time>
```

example:
```
,thread prune 30d
```

## automated thread features

### auto-archiving

automatically archive threads after a period of inactivity:

```
,thread autoarchive <time> #channel
```

example:
```
,thread autoarchive 24h #support
```

### welcome messages

set custom welcome messages for new thread members:

```
,thread welcome <message>
```

example:
```
,thread welcome Thanks for joining the discussion! Please read the pinned message.
```

## thread tags

organize threads with custom tags:

```
,thread tag add <tag>
```

remove a tag:

```
,thread tag remove <tag>
```

list all tags:

```
,thread tags
```

## troubleshooting

if thread commands aren't working:

- ensure enovuh has "manage threads" permission
- check if the channel supports threads (text channels and announcements)
- verify you have the appropriate permissions to manage the thread
- for auto-thread creation, make sure the channel isn't at the thread limit
