## translation commands

| command | description | usage | example |

| `translate set` | set your preferred language | `translate set <language code>` | `translate set es` |

## live translation

with live translation, enovuh will automatically translate your messages to your preferred language whenever you send a message in a different language. this feature is perfect for multilingual servers where members speak different languages.

### enabling live translation

1. set your preferred language:
```
,translate set en
```

2. enable live translation:
```
,translate toggle
```

once enabled, enovuh will detect the language of your messages and translate them to your preferred language if they're in a different language.

### disabling live translation

to disable live translation:
```
,translate toggle
```

## commonly used language codes

| code | language | code | language |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- |
| `en` | english | `ja` | japanese |
| `es` | spanish | `ko` | korean |
| `fr` | french | `zh-cn` | chinese (simplified) |
| `de` | german | `ru` | russian |
| `it` | italian | `ar` | arabic |
| `pt` | portuguese | `hi` | hindi |

for a full list of supported languages:
```
,translatelist
```

## translation examples

### basic translation

translate text to your set language:
```
,translate hola cómo estás
```

### specific language translation

translate text to a specific language:
```
,translate this fr hello, how are you?
```

### viewing your settings

you can see your current translation settings by using the toggle command:
```
,translate toggle
```
this will show your current status along with toggling it.

## how it works

enovuh uses google's translation api to provide accurate translations. the system:

1. automatically detects the source language
2. translates the content to the target language
3. displays both the translation and language codes
4. preserves the original message for reference

## best practices

- use natural language for best translation results
- keep messages reasonably sized for more accurate translations
- remember that idioms and slang may not translate perfectly
- use specific language codes for more precise translations
- be patient with occasional translation errors

## troubleshooting

if translations aren't working:

- ensure you've set a valid language code
- check that live translation is enabled (if using that feature)
- verify that the message contains enough text to translate
- try using the direct translation command instead of live translation
