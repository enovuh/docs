## how it works

when you request a wordcloud, enovuh:

1. collects messages from the specified channel or user
2. filters out common words, mentions, emojis, and links
3. analyzes the frequency of remaining words
4. creates a visual representation where word size indicates frequency
5. applies your chosen color scheme
6. generates a high-resolution image

## word filtering

enovuh automatically filters out:
- common english words (e.g., "the", "and", "is")
- discord-specific terms (e.g., "discord", "http", "www")
- mentions, emojis, and urls
- most special characters and punctuation

this ensures your wordcloud focuses on the meaningful content of conversations.

## troubleshooting

if your wordcloud command isn't working:

- for user wordclouds, ensure the user has sent enough messages
