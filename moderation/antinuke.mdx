# antinuke

enovuh's antinuke system provides real-time protection against malicious actions that could damage your server. it monitors administrative actions and automatically responds to suspicious behavior.

## key features

- **rapid response** - instantly detects and counters nuke attempts
- **multi-action detection** - monitors various types of destructive actions
- **whitelist system** - allows trusted users to perform administrative actions
- **customizable thresholds** - adjust sensitivity based on your server's needs
- **detailed logging** - records all detected threats and actions taken
- **punishment options** - choose how to handle detected threats

## getting started

enable the antinuke system for your server:

```
,antinuke
```

to view current antinuke settings:

```
,antinuke config
```

## protected actions

the antinuke system monitors several potentially destructive actions:

### channel protection

prevents mass channel creation or deletion:

```
,antinuke channels <on/off> [threshold]
```

the threshold sets how many channel actions within a short time frame trigger the protection (default: 3).

### role protection

prevents mass role creation or deletion:

```
,antinuke roles <on/off> [threshold]
```

the threshold determines how many role actions trigger the protection (default: 3).

### ban protection

prevents mass banning of members:

```
,antinuke bans <on/off> [threshold]
```

the threshold sets how many bans within a short time period trigger the protection (default: 3).

### kick protection

prevents mass kicking of members:

```
,antinuke kicks <on/off> [threshold]
```

the threshold sets how many kicks within a short time period trigger the protection (default: 5).

### webhook protection

prevents creation of malicious webhooks:

```
,antinuke webhooks <on/off>
```

### server settings protection

prevents unwanted changes to server settings:

```
,antinuke server <on/off>
```

this protects against changes to the server's name, icon, or other critical settings.

### bot protection

prevents unauthorized bot additions:

```
,antinuke bots <on/off>
```

when enabled, only whitelisted users can add bots to the server.

## whitelist system

the whitelist system allows trusted users to perform administrative actions without triggering the antinuke:

```
,antinuke whitelist add <@user>
```

remove a user from the whitelist:

```
,antinuke whitelist remove <@user>
```

view all whitelisted users:

```
,antinuke whitelist list
```

## punishment options

configure what happens when the antinuke system detects suspicious activity:

```
,antinuke punishment <action>
```

available actions:

- `none` - only log the detection, no automatic action
- `strip` - remove all administrative permissions
- `kick` - remove the user from the server
- `ban` - ban the user from the server
- `stripban` - remove permissions and ban the user

the default action is `stripban`.

## recovery tools

in case a nuke attempt succeeds, enovuh provides recovery tools:

```
,antinuke recovery
```

this attempts to:

- restore deleted channels
- restore deleted roles
- unban innocent members
- fix server settings

**note:** recovery is most effective when run immediately after a nuke attempt.

## testing mode

test your antinuke configuration without applying punishments:

```
,antinuke test <on/off>
```

when test mode is enabled, the system will detect and log threats but won't take action against users.

## logging

configure where antinuke alerts are sent:

```
,antinuke log <#channel>
```

disable logging:

```
,antinuke log off
```

## quarantine mode

enables emergency protection during active attacks:

```
,antinuke quarantine <on/off>
```

when quarantine mode is active:

- all admin actions require verification
- new members cannot perform actions
- server enters temporary lockdown
- only the server owner and whitelisted users can make changes

this mode is recommended only during active attacks.

## best practices

for effective antinuke protection:

1. **whitelist carefully** - only add users you absolutely trust
2. **adjust thresholds** - set thresholds based on your server size and activity
3. **enable all protections** - for maximum security, enable all protection modules
4. **set up proper logging** - ensure logs are sent to a private staff channel
5. **run periodic tests** - use test mode to verify your configuration works

## advanced configuration

### trust levels

assign different levels of trust to users:

```
,antinuke trust <@user> <level>
```

trust levels:

- `0` - no special trust (default)
- `1` - basic trust (can perform limited actions)
- `2` - moderate trust (can perform most actions)
- `3` - full trust (equivalent to whitelist)

### intelligent detection

enable machine learning-based threat detection:

```
,antinuke intelligent <on/off>
```

when enabled, the system learns your server's normal administrative patterns and can better identify suspicious behavior.

### backup scheduling

create automatic server backups:

```
,antinuke backup <frequency>
```

frequencies:

- `daily` - backup once per day
- `weekly` - backup once per week
- `monthly` - backup once per month
- `off` - disable automatic backups

## troubleshooting

if antinuke isn't working as expected:

- verify enovuh has the necessary permissions (administrator or equivalent)
- ensure the antinuke module is enabled
- check if the user performing actions is whitelisted
- review your threshold settings
- confirm punishment settings are configured correctly
