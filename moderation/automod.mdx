# automod

enovuh's automod system automatically filters and takes action on problematic content without requiring constant moderator presence. it helps maintain a clean and safe environment for your community.

## key features

- **automated content filtering** - detects and removes harmful content
- **customizable triggers** - create rules based on your server's needs
- **multiple action types** - from simple warnings to timeouts and bans
- **threshold-based monitoring** - takes action after repeated offenses
- **anti-raid protection** - detects and mitigates server raids
- **detailed logging** - records all automod actions for review

## getting started

enable the automod system for your server:

```
,automod
```

to view current automod settings:

```
,automod config
```

## filtering modules

the automod system includes several built-in filtering modules that you can enable or disable individually.

### anti-spam

prevents rapid message sending and message repeating:

```
,automod spam <on/off> [threshold] [time]
```

- `threshold` - number of messages before triggering (default: 5)
- `time` - time period in seconds (default: 3)

example:

```
,automod spam on 6 4
```

this detects when a user sends 6 or more messages within 4 seconds.

### invite filter

blocks Discord invite links from being posted:

```
,automod invites <on/off>
```

you can whitelist specific servers whose invites are allowed:

```
,automod invites whitelist add <server_id>
```

to remove a whitelisted server:

```
,automod invites whitelist remove <server_id>
```

### word filter

blocks messages containing banned words or phrases:

```
,automod filter <on/off>
```

add words to the filter:

```
,automod filter add <word>
```

remove words from the filter:

```
,automod filter remove <word>
```

list all filtered words:

```
,automod filter list
```

the filter is smart enough to detect:

- variations of words (zero-width characters, special characters)
- words embedded within other words
- leetspeak substitutions (e.g., "3" for "e")

### link filter

controls which links can be posted:

```
,automod links <mode>
```

available modes:

- `off` - no link filtering
- `blacklist` - only block specific domains
- `whitelist` - block all domains except whitelisted ones
- `all` - block all links

manage domain lists:

```
,automod links add <domain>
,automod links remove <domain>
,automod links list
```

### caps filter

prevents excessive use of capital letters:

```
,automod caps <on/off> [percentage]
```

the percentage parameter sets the threshold for what's considered excessive (default: 70%).

### mention spam

prevents mass mentioning of users, roles, or everyone:

```
,automod mentions <on/off> [threshold]
```

the threshold sets how many mentions in a single message trigger the filter (default: 5).

### anti-raid

detects and mitigates server raids:

```
,automod raid <on/off> [joins] [seconds]
```

- `joins` - number of joins that trigger raid detection (default: 10)
- `seconds` - time window for those joins (default: 10)

raid actions:

```
,automod raid action <action>
```

available actions:

- `alert` - notify moderators only
- `lockdown` - temporarily lock all channels
- `kick` - kick all new accounts joining during the raid
- `ban` - ban all new accounts joining during the raid

### scam detection

identifies and removes common scam messages:

```
,automod scam <on/off>
```

this uses machine learning to identify phishing links, free nitro scams, and other common Discord scams.

### anti-hoisting

prevents name hoisting (using symbols to appear at the top of member lists):

```
,automod hoist <on/off>
```

when enabled, it automatically renames users with hoisted names.

## punishment system

configure what happens when automod rules are triggered:

```
,automod action <module> <action>
```

available actions:

- `delete` - delete the message only
- `warn` - delete and warn the user
- `timeout` - delete and timeout the user
- `kick` - delete and kick the user
- `ban` - delete and ban the user

example:

```
,automod action spam timeout
```

### threshold-based punishments

set escalating punishments based on violation count:

```
,automod threshold <count> <action>
```

example:

```
,automod threshold 3 timeout 10m
,automod threshold 5 ban
```

this applies a 10-minute timeout after 3 violations and a ban after 5.

### punishment durations

set the duration for timeouts:

```
,automod timeout <duration>
```

the duration format accepts:

- `s` for seconds
- `m` for minutes
- `h` for hours
- `d` for days

example:

```
,automod timeout 2h
```

## exemptions

certain channels, roles, or users can be exempted from automod:

### exempt channels

```
,automod exempt channel add <#channel>
,automod exempt channel remove <#channel>
,automod exempt channel list
```

### exempt roles

```
,automod exempt role add <@role>
,automod exempt role remove <@role>
,automod exempt role list
```

### exempt users

```
,automod exempt user add <@user>
,automod exempt user remove <@user>
,automod exempt user list
```

## logging

configure where automod actions are logged:

```
,automod log <#channel>
```

disable logging:

```
,automod log off
```

## advanced features

### custom filters

create custom automod rules with complex conditions:

```
,automod custom add <name> <trigger> <action>
```

- `name` - identifier for the custom rule
- `trigger` - what activates the rule (regex pattern)
- `action` - what happens when triggered

example:

```
,automod custom add creditcard (\d{4}[-\s]?){4} delete
```

this detects and removes messages containing credit card number patterns.

### anti-phishing

automatically detect and remove phishing links:

```
,automod phishing <on/off>
```

this uses an up-to-date database of known phishing domains.

### content scanning

detect NSFW content in images and attachments:

```
,automod content <on/off>
```

when enabled, it uses machine learning to scan uploaded images.

## best practices

for an effective automod system:

1. **start light** - begin with minimal restrictions, then add more as needed
2. **use appropriate punishments** - match the severity of the action to the offense
3. **exempt trusted roles** - prevent automod from interfering with staff
4. **test new rules** - verify custom filters work as expected before deployment
5. **review logs regularly** - check for false positives or missed violations

## troubleshooting

if automod isn't working as expected:

- verify enovuh has the necessary permissions (manage messages, moderate members)
- ensure the automod module is enabled
- check if the user/channel/role is exempted
- review your action settings
- confirm punishment thresholds are configured correctly
