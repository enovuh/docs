# sentinel automod

enovuh's sentinel automod system automatically monitors, filters, and moderates your server's chat to maintain a healthy community environment without constant manual oversight.

## core concept

sentinel works by analyzing messages through multiple filter layers and applying configurable actions when violations are detected.

## quickstart

enable the automod system with one command:

```
,sentinel
```

to view your current setup:

```
,sentinel status
```

## filter matrix

enovuh uses a multi-layered approach to content filtering:

### text filters

control unwanted text content:

```
,sentinel text <filter> <on/off>
```

available text filters:
- `profanity` - blocks offensive language
- `slurs` - blocks discriminatory terms
- `toxicity` - blocks hostile messages
- `nsfw` - blocks adult content descriptions
- `spam` - blocks repeated messages
- `zalgo` - blocks text with excessive diacritics

### pattern filters

detect and block specific patterns:

```
,sentinel pattern <type> <on/off>
```

available pattern types:
- `caps` - excessive capital letters
- `emoji` - emoji spam
- `mentions` - mass user/role tagging
- `newlines` - excessive line breaks
- `invites` - discord server invites
- `links` - external urls

### content filters

analyze non-text content:

```
,sentinel content <type> <on/off>
```

available content types:
- `images` - checks for inappropriate images
- `files` - scans attachments for malware
- `embeds` - filters embedded content
- `stickers` - moderates sticker usage

## building custom filters

create specialized filters for your server's needs:

```
,sentinel custom <name> <pattern> <action>
```

example creating a filter for phone numbers:
```
,sentinel custom phone-numbers "(\d{3}[-\.\s]??\d{3}[-\.\s]??\d{4}|\(\d{3}\)\s*\d{3}[-\.\s]??\d{4})" delete
```

## response system

define how sentinel responds to violations:

```
,sentinel action <filter> <action>
```

available actions:
- `log` - only record the violation
- `warn` - notify the user
- `delete` - remove the message
- `mute` - temporarily restrict chat access
- `kick` - remove from server
- `ban` - permanently remove from server
- `quarantine` - move to restricted channel

## advanced moderation

### adaptive learning

enable ai-powered filtering that improves over time:

```
,sentinel learn <on/off>
```

when enabled, sentinel:
- adapts to your server's communication style
- reduces false positives
- identifies emerging problematic patterns
- requires minimal manual configuration

### escalation system

create graduated response to repeated violations:

```
,sentinel escalate <count> <action>
```

example escalation setup:
```
,sentinel escalate 3 mute 10m
,sentinel escalate 5 mute 1h
,sentinel escalate 7 kick
```

### context awareness

enable smart filtering that considers message context:

```
,sentinel context <on/off>
```

this allows sentinel to:
- understand conversation flow
- detect problematic behavior patterns
- reduce false positives in role-play channels
- identify ban evasion attempts

## channel management

### channel-specific settings

apply different rules to different channels:

```
,sentinel channel <#channel> <preset>
```

available presets:
- `strict` - heavy filtering
- `normal` - balanced moderation
- `relaxed` - minimal intervention
- `media` - focus on image/file scanning
- `links` - focus on url filtering
- `custom` - use your saved configuration

### excluded channels

set channels where automod is inactive:

```
,sentinel exclude <#channel>
```

## user management

### excluded roles

exempt specific roles from moderation:

```
,sentinel bypass <@role>
```

### monitored roles

apply extra scrutiny to specific roles:

```
,sentinel focus <@role>
```

## real-time moderation

### raid protection

automatically detect and counter chat raids:

```
,sentinel raid <on/off>
```

when enabled, sentinel will:
- detect unusual message patterns
- identify coordinated spam attacks
- temporarily increase moderation strictness
- automatically apply slowmode

### quarantine system

isolate problematic users without banning:

```
,sentinel quarantine <@user> [duration]
```

this creates a special role that:
- restricts channel access
- prevents sending attachments
- limits message frequency
- maintains user presence for mod discussion

## integration options

### verification connection

link with verification system:

```
,sentinel verify <on/off>
```

when enabled:
- new users face stricter moderation
- verification increases trust score
- trust score affects filter sensitivity

### report system

allow members to flag content:

```
,sentinel reports <on/off>
```

when enabled, members can report content:
```
,report <message-link> <reason>
```

## monitoring dashboard

view moderation statistics and patterns:

```
,sentinel stats
```

this displays:
- recent violation counts
- most common filter triggers
- user violation patterns
- effectiveness metrics

## unique features

### smart phishing detection

automatically identify and block scam links:

```
,sentinel phishing <on/off>
```

this feature:
- uses real-time database of malicious urls
- detects obfuscated links
- recognizes typosquatting domains
- prevents discord token theft attempts

### content analysis

scan images for inappropriate content:

```
,sentinel scan <on/off>
```

this feature uses ai to detect:
- explicit imagery
- violent content
- hate symbols
- personal identification

  sentinel can be configured to work in "training mode" where it only logs violations without taking action, helping you fine-tune your settings before full deployment.
