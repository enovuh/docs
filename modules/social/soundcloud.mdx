- **Track Notifications**: Get notified in Discord when a linked Soundcloud account uploads new tracks.
- **Profile Information**: Display basic information about a Soundcloud profile.
- **Track Display**: Show details and links for Soundcloud tracks.

## Commands

- `/soundcloud track [username]`: Starts tracking a Soundcloud account for new uploads.
- `/soundcloud untrack [username]`: Stops tracking a Soundcloud account.
- `/soundcloud profile [username]`: Shows basic information about a Soundcloud profile.
- `/soundcloud latest [username]`: Displays the latest track from a tracked Soundcloud account.

## Configuration

Configuration for the Soundcloud module involves setting up API access (if required by Soundcloud's policies) and defining which channels receive notifications.

```
