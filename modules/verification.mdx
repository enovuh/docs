# gatekeeper verification

enovuh's gatekeeper system provides robust, customizable verification processes to protect your server from unauthorized access, raids, and malicious accounts while creating a frictionless experience for legitimate members.

## verification philosophy

gatekeeper uses a risk-based approach where:
- verification difficulty scales with detected risk
- multiple verification methods can be combined
- user experience is prioritized for legitimate users
- suspicious patterns trigger additional checks

## basic setup

enable verification with a simple command:

```
,gate
```

this activates the default verification setup. for customization:

```
,gate setup
```

## verification methods

gatekeeper offers multiple verification approaches that can be used individually or in combination:

### captcha challenge

protect against automated bots with image-based verification:

```
,gate captcha <on/off>
```

captcha options:
```
,gate captcha difficulty <easy/medium/hard>
```

```
,gate captcha attempts <number>
```
sets maximum failed attempts before timeout.

### reaction verification

simple, one-click verification process:

```
,gate reaction <on/off> [emoji]
```

custom reaction message:
```
,gate reaction message <text>
```

### account screening

filter members based on account criteria:

```
,gate screen <on/off>
```

screening options:
```
,gate screen age <days>
```
requires accounts to be older than specified days.

```
,gate screen avatar <on/off>
```
requires members to have a custom avatar.

```
,gate screen username <filter>
```
screens for suspicious username patterns.

### verification questions

require members to answer custom questions:

```
,gate questions <on/off>
```

manage questions:
```
,gate questions add <question> <answer>
```

```
,gate questions remove <id>
```

```
,gate questions list
```

### email verification

connect discord accounts to email addresses:

```
,gate email <on/off> [domain]
```

email options:
```
,gate email required <on/off>
```
determines if email verification is mandatory.

```
,gate email domains <add/remove> <domain>
```
manage allowed email domains.

### phone verification

require phone verification for higher security:

```
,gate phone <on/off>
```

phone options:
```
,gate phone countries <add/remove> <country-code>
```
manage allowed country codes.

## verification flow

### welcome message

customize the initial greeting:

```
,gate welcome <message>
```

dynamic welcome:
```
,gate welcome dynamic <on/off>
```
changes welcome message based on server activity.

### verification channel

designate where verification occurs:

```
,gate channel <#channel>
```

channel options:
```
,gate channel type <public/private>
```
controls visibility of the verification process.

```
,gate channel timeout <minutes>
```
automatically removes inactive verification attempts.

### completion message

set the message shown after successful verification:

```
,gate complete <message>
```

### verification logs

track verification attempts:

```
,gate logs <#channel>
```

log options:
```
,gate logs detail <basic/normal/verbose>
```
controls the amount of information logged.

## access management

### verified role

assign a role upon verification:

```
,gate role <@role>
```

### automatic permissions

configure server access before and after verification:

```
,gate access before <deny/limited/read>
```
sets pre-verification permissions.

```
,gate access after <full/custom>
```
sets post-verification permissions.

For custom access:
```
,gate access custom <@role>
```
uses an existing role's permissions as a template.

## advanced configuration

### verification layers

create multi-step verification processes:

```
,gate layers <number>
```

layer configuration:
```
,gate layer <number> <method>
```

example creating a two-layer system:
```
,gate layers 2
,gate layer 1 reaction
,gate layer 2 captcha
```

### risk-based verification

enable adaptive verification difficulty:

```
,gate adaptive <on/off>
```

when enabled, verification becomes more rigorous for suspicious accounts.

risk triggers:
```
,gate risk <trigger> <on/off>
```

available triggers:
- `newaccount` - recently created accounts
- `noavatar` - accounts without avatars
- `suspicious` - accounts with suspicious patterns
- `vpn` - detected vpn/proxy usage
- `rapid` - rapid join patterns

### raid protection

activate enhanced verification during detected raids:

```
,gate raid <on/off>
```

raid options:
```
,gate raid threshold <joins> <seconds>
```
defines what constitutes a raid pattern.

```
,gate raid mode <lockdown/challenge/manual>
```
determines how the system responds during raids.

### verification limits

control verification flow:

```
,gate limit <per-minute> <max-pending>
```

example:
```
,gate limit 10 30
```
allows 10 verifications per minute with maximum 30 pending.

## member management

### manual verification

verify members manually:

```
,gate verify <@user>
```

### bypassing verification

exempt certain users from verification:

```
,gate bypass user <@user>
```

exempt roles from verification:
```
,gate bypass role <@role>
```

view all exemptions:
```
,gate bypass list
```

### reverification

require existing members to verify again:

```
,gate reverify <@role>
```

scheduled reverification:
```
,gate reverify schedule <interval>
```
periodically requires members to re-verify.

## advanced features

### verification analytics

view verification statistics:

```
,gate stats
```

this shows:
- success/failure rates
- common failure reasons
- verification times
- suspicious patterns

### custom verification scripts

create advanced verification logic:

```
,gate script <create/edit/delete> <name>
```

script editing opens an interactive editor for creating verification flows.

### member scoring

enable risk score calculation for new members:

```
,gate score <on/off>
```

when enabled, members receive a trust score that can be used with other enovuh features.

view member scores:
```
,gate score <@user>
```

### anti-alt detection

identify and manage alternate accounts:

```
,gate alts <on/off>
```

alt management:
```
,gate alts action <log/restrict/block>
```
determines how alt accounts are handled.
