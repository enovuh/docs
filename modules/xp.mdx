# pulse xp system

enovuh's pulse xp system transforms server activity into a rewarding progression journey, driving engagement through personalized advancement paths, achievements, and rewards.

## core mechanics

the pulse system awards experience points based on meaningful engagement:

## experience sources

pulse offers multiple ways for members to earn xp:

### text participation

```

the multiplier controls how much xp is earned per qualifying message (default: 1.0).

custom text settings:
```
,pulse text mindist <seconds>
```
sets the minimum time between xp awards to prevent spam.

```
,pulse text minlength <characters>
```
sets the minimum message length that qualifies for xp.

### voice activity

```
,pulse voice <multiplier>
```

the multiplier controls xp rate in voice channels (default: 1.0).

voice options:
