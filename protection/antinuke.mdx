# antinuke protection

enovuh's antinuke system is designed to protect your server from malicious nuking attempts by monitoring critical administrative actions and automatically punishing users who trigger suspicious activity. this powerful system helps server owners maintain security even when they're offline.

## what is server nuking?

server nuking is the act of maliciously destroying a discord server by:

- mass deleting channels and roles
- mass banning members
- changing server permissions
- creating spam channels
- removing server features
- changing vanity URLs

these attacks often happen when trusted users have their accounts compromised or when malicious users gain administrative access.

## how antinuke works

enovuh's antinuke system operates through continuous monitoring:

1. the system actively watches all administrative actions in the server
2. when suspicious patterns are detected, it triggers automatic protection
3. the offending user is immediately restricted based on your configured punishment
4. detailed logs are provided so you can review the incident
5. when possible, enovuh will attempt to restore deleted channels and roles

## protection modules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="webhook protection" icon="link">
    prevents mass webhook creation and deletion. webhooks are often used to spam servers during nuking attacks.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke webhook <on/off> [threshold] [time]`
    
    **example:** `,antinuke webhook on 3 10` (triggers after 3 webhook actions within 10 seconds)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="channel protection" icon="hashtag">
    detects and prevents mass channel creation or deletion. this is one of the most common nuking activities.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke channel <on/off> [threshold] [time]`
    
    **example:** `,antinuke channel on 5 30` (triggers after 5 channel deletions within 30 seconds)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="role protection" icon="users-rectangle">
    prevents mass role deletion or dangerous permission changes to roles.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke role <on/off> [threshold] [time]`
    
    **example:** `,antinuke role on 3 15` (triggers after 3 role deletions within 15 seconds)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="ban protection" icon="ban">
    prevents mass banning of server members, a common nuking behavior.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke ban <on/off> [threshold] [time]`
    
    **example:** `,antinuke ban on 7 60` (triggers after 7 bans within 60 seconds)

  <Accordion title="kick protection" icon="user-slash">
    prevents mass kicking of server members.

    **example:** `,antinuke kick on 5 30` (triggers after 5 kicks within 30 seconds)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="emoji protection" icon="face-smile">
    prevents mass emoji deletion, which impacts server identity.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke emoji <on/off> [threshold] [time]`
    
    **example:** `,antinuke emoji on 10 60` (triggers after 10 emoji deletions within 60 seconds)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="bot addition protection" icon="robot">
    controls the addition of potentially malicious bots to your server.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke botadd <on/off>`
    
    **example:** `,antinuke botadd on`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="permission protection" icon="key">
    monitors dangerous permission changes, such as granting administrator privileges.
    
    **command:** `,antinuke permissions <on/off>`

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="vanity protection" icon="link">
    protects your custom server URL from being changed.

## getting started

the quickest way to set up antinuke is to use the guided setup:

```
,antinuke setup
```

this interactive process will help you configure all protection modules with recommended settings for your server size.

alternatively, you can enable antinuke with default settings:

```
,antinuke
```

## configuration options

### punishment settings

choose how enovuh responds to detected nuke attempts:

```
,antinuke punishment <type>
```

available punishment types:

- `ban` - permanently removes the attacker (default)
- `kick` - removes the attacker but allows them to rejoin
- `jail` - restricts the attacker's permissions without removal

### viewing your configuration

check your current antinuke settings:

```
,antinuke config
```

this displays all active modules, their thresholds, and your selected punishment type.

## whitelist system

trusted users should be whitelisted to prevent false triggers:

```
,antinuke whitelist @user
```

to view all whitelisted users:

```
,antinuke list
```

## antinuke admins

as a server owner, you can designate trusted members as antinuke admins:

```
,antinuke admin @user
```

antinuke admins can manage settings but can't disable the system completely.

to view current antinuke admins:

```
,antinuke admins
```

## advanced features

### permission monitoring

granular control over which permission changes trigger protection:

```
,antinuke perm add <permission> <grant/remove>
```

example:

```
,antinuke perm add administrator grant
```

this would monitor when administrator permissions are granted to roles or users.

to view monitored permissions:

```
,antinuke perm list
```

### manual recovery

if you need to manually recover from a nuke attempt:

```
,recover channels
```

to recover roles:

```
,recover roles
```

## real-time monitoring

enovuh provides real-time monitoring of critical actions through server logs. configure a log channel to receive detailed information:

```
,logs antinuke #security-logs
```

## best practices

for optimal protection:

1. **whitelist trusted administrators** - prevent false positives
2. **use appropriate thresholds** - customize based on server size and activity
3. **regular log reviews** - check security logs periodically
4. **layered security** - combine with antiraid and joingate for complete protection
5. **test your settings** - verify protection works with controlled tests

## requirements

- enovuh must have **administrator** permissions
- for vanity protection, your server must be level 3 with a custom url
- server owner permission is required to toggle antinuke on/off

## troubleshooting

if antinuke isn't responding as expected:

- ensure enovuh has administrator permissions
- verify the correct modules are enabled
- check if threshold values are appropriate for your server size
- make sure offenders aren't whitelisted
- review logs for any error messages
