# permission system

enovuh's permission system provides precise control over who can use which commands in your server, allowing you to create a custom hierarchy that matches your server's needs.

## permission concepts

enovuh's permission system works through:

1. **command groups** - sets of related commands
2. **permission levels** - numeric values (0-5) determining access
3. **role bindings** - associations between discord roles and permission levels
4. **command overrides** - specific exceptions to the general permissions
5. **channel restrictions** - limiting where commands can be used

## basic permissions

view current permission settings:

```
,perms view
```

this displays all permission levels and associated roles.

## permission levels

enovuh uses six permission levels:

| level | name | default access | typical roles |
|-------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 0 | member | basic utility commands | @everyone |
| 1 | helper | informational commands | helpers, trial mods |
| 2 | moderator | moderation tools | moderators |
| 3 | administrator | configuration commands | admins |
| 4 | manager | critical server settings | server managers |
| 5 | owner | all commands | server owner |

## setting permissions

### role-based permissions

assign a permission level to a role:

```
,perms role <@role> <level>
```

example:
```
,perms role @Moderator 2
```

view role permissions:
```
,perms roles
```

### user-based permissions

assign a permission level to a specific user:

```
,perms user <@user> <level>
```

this overrides the user's role-based permissions.

view user-specific permissions:
```
,perms users
```

## command management

### viewing command requirements

check what permission level a command requires:

```
,perms cmd <command>
```

### command overrides

change the permission level for a specific command:

```
,perms override <command> <level>
```

example:
```
,perms override ban 3
```
this changes the `ban` command to require level 3 instead of its default.

view all command overrides:
```
,perms overrides
```

remove a command override:
```
,perms override <command> reset
```

## group management

commands are organized into logical groups for easier management.

view command groups:
```
,perms groups
```

set permission level for an entire group:
```
,perms group <group-name> <level>
```

## channel restrictions

### command channels

restrict a command to specific channels:

```
,perms channel <command> <#channel1> <#channel2>
```

remove channel restrictions:
```
,perms channel <command> reset
```

### disabled channels

disable commands in specific channels:

```
,perms disable <#channel> <commands/all>
```

re-enable commands:
```
,perms enable <#channel> <commands/all>
```

## advanced management

### permission templates

save your current permission setup as a template:

```
,perms template save <name>
```

load a template:
```
,perms template load <name>
```

view available templates:
```
,perms templates
```

### permission audit

view a log of permission changes:

```
,perms audit
```

### permission reset

reset all permissions to default:

```
,perms reset
```

this requires confirmation and can't be undone.

## common use cases

### moderator setup

establish basic moderation permissions:

```
,perms role @Moderator 2
,perms override warn 1
,perms override mute 2
,perms override ban 3
```

this gives moderators standard moderation powers, allows helpers to warn, but reserves bans for administrators.

### public commands

create a channel for public utility commands:

```
,perms disable #general all
,perms enable #general weather avatar profile
```

this restricts most commands from #general but allows a few helpful ones.

### tiered moderation

create a moderation ladder:

```
,perms role @Helper 1
,perms role @Moderator 2
,perms role @SeniorMod 3
,perms override kick 2
,perms override tempban 2
,perms override ban 3
```

this creates a progression from helpers to senior moderators with increasing capabilities.

## contextual permission checks

enable smart permission evaluation:

```
,perms context <on/off>
```

when enabled, enovuh considers:
- self-target actions (allowing users to use commands on themselves)
- role hierarchy (preventing moderation of higher-ranked users)
- permission inheritance (allowing higher levels to use lower-level commands)

## cross-server permissions

for users with enovuh in multiple servers:

```
,perms global <@user> <level>
```

this command is restricted to the bot owner.

## permission troubleshooting

if someone can't use a command they should have access to, check:

1. their assigned role permissions with `,perms role <@role>`
2. any user-specific overrides with `,perms user <@user>`
3. command-specific requirements with `,perms cmd <command>`
4. channel restrictions with `,perms channels <command>`
5. disabled channels with `,perms disabled`

<Card title="pro tip" icon="lightbulb" color="#9333EA">
  create a special "command access" role that doesn't provide any discord permissions but grants enovuh permission level 1 â€“ this lets you give members access to utility commands without moderation privileges.
