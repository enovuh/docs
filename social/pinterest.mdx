- `{description}` - pin description
- `{url}` - pin url

```

## usage examples

### basic setup

set up notifications for a pinterest account:

```
add #design-inspiration designmilk
```

### customizing notifications

add a custom message with notifications:

```
add #home-decor apartmenttherapy
message apartmenttherapy "new home decor ideas! üè† {url}"
```

allow role mentions in your notifications:

```
message apartmenttherapy "@design check out this pin! {url}" --ping
```

### embed settings

toggle embed display for all pinterest notifications:

```
embeds on
```

## troubleshooting

if notifications aren't working:

- ensure the bot has permission to send messages in the target channel
- verify the pinterest username is spelled correctly
- check if the account has recently posted new pins
- the bot checks for updates every 20 minutes, so new pins won't appear immediately

  for the best visual experience, keep embeds enabled so users can preview pins
  directly in discord without having to click links.
