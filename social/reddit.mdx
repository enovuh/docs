## usage examples

### basic setup

set up notifications for a subreddit and user:

```
follow subreddit #news worldnews
follow user #memes srgrafo
```

### customizing notifications

add custom messages with notifications:

```
follow subreddit #gaming games
message subreddit games "new post in r/games: {title} {url}"
```

allow role mentions in your notifications:

```
message user spez "@everyone reddit admin post! {title} {url}" --ping
```

## troubleshooting

if notifications aren't working:

- ensure the bot has permission to send messages in the target channel
- verify the subreddit or username is spelled correctly
- reddit has rate limits which may affect the frequency of checks
- the bot checks for updates every 30 minutes, so new posts won't appear immediately
