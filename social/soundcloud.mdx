# soundcloud integration

keep your server updated with real-time notifications whenever specified soundcloud artists upload new tracks.

## setup

configure soundcloud notifications:

```
,soundcloud add <#channel> <username>
```

sets up notifications for a specific soundcloud artist to be sent to the specified channel

## managing subscriptions

manage soundcloud notification subscriptions:

```
,soundcloud remove <#channel> <username>
```

stops monitoring a soundcloud artist in a specific channel

```
,soundcloud list
```

shows all soundcloud artists currently being monitored in your server

## customization

personalize your soundcloud notifications:

```
,soundcloud message <username> <message>
```

sets a custom message to be sent with notifications

available placeholders:

- `{username}` - soundcloud username
- `{title}` - track title
- `{description}` - track description
- `{url}` - track url
- `{duration}` - track duration

add the `--ping` flag to allow mentions in the message:

```
,soundcloud message <username> new track from our partner! check it out! --ping
```

```
,soundcloud message_view <username>
```

views the custom message configured for an artist

## artist information

view information about soundcloud artists:

```
,soundcloud <username>
```

displays information about a soundcloud artist, including follower count and track count

```
,soundcloud tracks <username>
```

lists the most recent tracks from a soundcloud artist

## usage examples

### basic setup

set up notifications for a soundcloud artist:

```
add #music-releases deadmau5
```

### customizing notifications

add a custom message with notifications:

```
add #edm-releases flume
message flume "new track from flume! ðŸŽµ {title} - {duration} {url}"
```

allow role mentions in your notifications:

```
message flume "@music-fans check out the latest track! {title} {url}" --ping
```

## troubleshooting

if notifications aren't working:

- ensure the bot has permission to send messages in the target channel
- verify the soundcloud username is spelled correctly
- check if the artist has recently uploaded new tracks
- the bot checks for updates every 20 minutes, so new tracks won't appear immediately

  for artists who upload frequently, create a dedicated channel for their
  notifications to avoid cluttering your general music channels.
