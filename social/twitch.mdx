# twitch integration

keep your server updated with real-time notifications whenever specified twitch streamers go live.

## setup

configure twitch notifications:

```
,twitch add <#channel> <streamer>
```

sets up notifications for a specific twitch streamer to be sent to the specified channel

## managing subscriptions

manage twitch notification subscriptions:

```
,twitch remove <#channel> <streamer>
```

stops monitoring a twitch streamer in a specific channel

```
,twitch list
```

shows all twitch streamers currently being monitored in your server

## customization

personalize your twitch notifications:

```
,twitch message <streamer> <message>
```

sets a custom message to be sent with notifications

available placeholders:

- `{username}` - twitch username
- `{title}` - stream title
- `{game}` - game being played
- `{url}` - stream url
- `{viewers}` - current viewer count

add the `--ping` flag to allow mentions in the message:

```
,twitch message <streamer> new stream from our partner! check it out! --ping
```

```
,twitch message_view <streamer>
```

views the custom message configured for a streamer

## streamer information

view information about twitch streamers:

```
,twitch <streamer>
```

displays information about a twitch streamer, including if they are currently live

## usage examples

### basic setup

set up notifications for a twitch streamer:

```
add #live-streams xqc
```

### customizing notifications

add a custom message with notifications:

```
add #gaming-streams pokimane
message pokimane "pokimane is live playing {game}! ðŸŽ® {url}"
```

allow role mentions in your notifications:

```
message pokimane "@streaming check out the live stream! playing {game} - {url}" --ping
```

## troubleshooting

if notifications aren't working:

- ensure the bot has permission to send messages in the target channel
- verify the twitch username is spelled correctly
- notifications are only sent when a streamer goes live, not for the entire duration of the stream
- the bot checks for updates every 5 minutes, so there may be a slight delay in notifications

  if you want to highlight specific games, create separate channels for
  different categories and set up notifications for the same streamer in
  multiple channels with different custom messages.
