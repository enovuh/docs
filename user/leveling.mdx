## troubleshooting

if the leveling system isn't working as expected:

- ensure the bot has the required permissions
- check if the user has a no-xp role assigned
- verify the channel doesn't have a 0 multiplier
- make sure messages meet the minimum length requirement
- confirm the user hasn't reached a daily xp cap
