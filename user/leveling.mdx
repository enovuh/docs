</Frame>

## key features

- **automatic xp tracking** - members earn xp naturally through chat activity
- **customizable level cards** - personalized rank cards displaying member progress
- **role rewards** - automatically assign roles when members reach specific levels
- **leaderboards** - competitive rankings to showcase top contributors
- **multi-channel configuration** - adjust xp rates for different channels

## getting started

enable the leveling system for your server:

```
,leveling
```

to view your current leveling system settings:

```
,leveling config
```

## member progression

members earn xp through regular conversation, with built-in rate limiting to prevent spam. xp is awarded based on several factors:

- message length and quality
- frequency of participation
- active time in voice channels
- server booster status (optional bonus)

## viewing ranks

members can check their current level and rank with:

```
,rank [@user]
```

this displays a customized rank card showing:
- current level and xp
- progress to next level
- server rank position
- total messages sent
- member since date

## leaderboard

view the server's top members by xp:

```
,leaderboard
```

you can also view specific leaderboard pages:

```
,leaderboard [page]
```

## level-up notifications

customize how members are notified when they level up:

```
,levelup <mode> [#channel]
```

available notification modes:
- `current` - send in the channel where the level-up occurred (default)
- `dm` - send a direct message to the user
- `channel` - send to a specific channel
- `off` - disable level-up messages

example setting a specific announcement channel:
```
,levelup channel #level-ups
```

## role rewards

automatically assign roles when members reach certain levels:

```
,levelrole add <level> <@role>
```

to remove a level role:
```
,levelrole remove <level>
```

to view all configured level roles:
```
,levelrole list
```

example:
```
,levelrole add 10 @Active Member
```

## customization options

### xp rates

adjust how much xp members earn per message:

```
,leveling xprate <amount>
```

the default rate is 15-25 xp per qualifying message.

### level-up multiplier

control how difficult it becomes to level up:

```
,leveling multiplier <value>
```

higher values mean more xp is required between levels (default: 100).

### channel settings

boost or restrict xp gain in specific channels:

```
,leveling channel <#channel> <multiplier>
```

examples:
- `0` - no xp in this channel
- `0.5` - half the normal xp rate
- `2` - double the normal xp rate

```
,leveling channel #general 1.5
```

### custom background

personalize rank cards with a custom background:

```
,rankcard background <image_url>
```

### xp boost for server boosters

reward members who boost your server with additional xp:

```
,leveling boosterbonus <multiplier>
```

a multiplier of 1.5 would give boosters 50% more xp.

## member management

### adjusting user xp

manually adjust a member's xp:

```
,level set @user <amount>
```

add xp to a member:
```
,level add @user <amount>
```

remove xp from a member:
```
,level remove @user <amount>
```

### resetting progress

reset a single user's levels and xp:
```
,level reset @user
```

reset the entire server's leveling data:
```
,leveling reset
```

**note:** server-wide reset requires confirmation and can't be undone.

## importing data

enovuh supports importing level data from other popular leveling bots:

```
,leveling import <bot>
```

supported bots for importing:
- mee6
- amari
- atlas
- lurkr

## advanced features

### no-xp roles

designate roles that shouldn't earn xp:

```
,leveling noxprole add @role
```

to remove a no-xp role:
```
,leveling noxprole remove @role
```

to list all no-xp roles:
```
,leveling noxprole list
```

### voice channel xp

enable xp for voice channel activity:

```
,leveling voice <on/off> [rate]
```

the rate determines how often xp is awarded (in minutes).

### message requirements

set minimum requirements for messages to earn xp:

```
,leveling minlength <characters>
```

messages shorter than this won't earn xp (default: 5).

## analytics

view detailed statistics about your leveling system:

```
,leveling stats
```

this shows:
- total xp earned server-wide
- average level of members
- most active channels
- leveling activity over time

## best practices

for an effective leveling system:

1. **balance xp rates** - make progression challenging but achievable
2. **create meaningful rewards** - ensure level roles provide actual benefits
3. **promote the leaderboard** - encourage friendly competition
4. **adjust channel multipliers** - reward participation in important channels
5. **combine with other features** - integrate with giveaways, applications, or verification

## troubleshooting

if the leveling system isn't working as expected:

- ensure enovuh has the required permissions
- check if the user has a no-xp role assigned
- verify the channel doesn't have a 0 multiplier
- make sure messages meet the minimum length requirement
- confirm the user hasn't reached a daily xp cap
